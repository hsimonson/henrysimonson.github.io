									<h1>About Henry<br />
									</h1>
									<p>Hi! Here you will find some information about what brings me happiness outside of developing my career.  Thanks for looking!</p>
								</header>
								<p>Since coming to Colorado in 2018, I have always tried to get outdoors to hike and camp whenever I had a chance.
									Being outdoors is a great way to disconnect and ground myself after a rough week or just to mentally prep for the week ahead.
									I also have three cats at home that I love as much as children.  Their names are Neko, Quete, and Freyja.
								</p>
								<!-- <div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>  -->
								<p>Besides nature and animals, I love to tinker and use my hands.  Recently, I have been restoring old gaming systems to challenge 
									myself to learn new skills such as soldering and using a multimeter for component testing. Other than electronics, I like to be chalenged as a mechanic. 
									I have a 2004 Volkswagen GTI that I have been slowly improving and repairing since 2017.  This summer, I plan to weld the body, prep for 
									paint, and replace all parts that are past their service limit.  Taking on large projects, even as hobbies, has taught me how to properly 
									plan, prepare, and execute my tasks so there is minimal chance of failure, even if I need a backup plan.

								</p> 
								<p>
									Thank you for reading, if you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out to me using the contact info at the bottom of the page.
